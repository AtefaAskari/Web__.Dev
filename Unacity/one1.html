        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <p>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci[b] (15 April 1452 â€“ 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath<br>
            of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist,<br>
            theorist, sculptor, and architect.[3] While his fame initially rested on his achievements<br>
            as a painter, he has also become known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes<br>
            on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and<br>
            paleontology.
